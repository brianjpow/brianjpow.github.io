      <div class="details body-copy">
        Glow Bugs was an endless runner free-to-play game with in-app purchases that supported cosmetics as well as elements that influenced gameplay. The game was pieced together using pre-built screens that were then seamlessly stitched together to create a different game every time, but ensuring the gameplay was interesting enough to encourage players to play over and over.

        The Glow Bugs screens were designed to reuse as many different hud and ui elements as possible to keep filesize low and loading fast. Any area where we were able to generate graphics in code was taken to keep the filesize under 50mb so the game could be downloaded without requiring wifi.

        The userflow was failry straightforward. We wanted to encourage players to continue to spend in game currency during a playthrough so we offered a place to continue playing from where they failed by spending soft currency.
