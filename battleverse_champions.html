        Battleverse Champions is a free-to-play mobile arena fighting game. It's mechanics are derived from popular games such as Brawl Stars, League of Legends and Vain Glory.

      <div class="details body-copy">
        I was responsible for building the layouts, wireframes and userflow of nearly 100 screens after a full game audit was performed. Additionally I mocked up full animation sequences, developed a whole new in-game HUD, and created a fully interactive prototype in Adobe XD.

        A full audit of the existing game was performed to identify key issues and begin to propose solutions. We also build a full userflow of the entire game as it currently stands.

        We would iterate through many different versions of the same content to find a layout that best served the user. Particularly complex screens such as these "match details" layouts proved challenging due to the density of information that needed to be presented.

       <div class="details body-copy graybg">
         When appropriate, I would animate the order the data appeared on the screen. Sequencing the information served a few purposes. First, since there was a lot to communicate to the user, this helped them parse one piece of data at a time. Second, it creates a satisfying response in the user to watch as progress is made towards completing challenges, badges, and character levels. Third, the client was able to clearly understand the timing, motion and order of how the information would animate onto the screen.
